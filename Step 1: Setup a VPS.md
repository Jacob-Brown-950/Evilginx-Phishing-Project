# Step 1: Setup a VPS

In this step, I provisioned a virtual private server (VPS) using Kamatera's free trial platform to host the Evilginx2 phishing simulation environment.

## 🖥️ VPS Provider: Kamatera

Kamatera offers a 30-day free trial with $100 in cloud credits, which is ideal for temporary security labs like this one.
